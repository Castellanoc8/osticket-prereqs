In the first step i had to enable IIS in windows. I did that by going to the control panel and openeing programs, once opened I clicked on the "turn windows features on or off" tab. Once inside I expanded the Internet Information Service tab(IIS), then I expanded the World Wide Web Services tab and clicked on Application Development Features. Once I was inside the ADF tab i checked off CGI and clicked ok to allow the computer to apply the changes I had made.

<p>
Next, I had to download and install the Rewrite Module. The Rewrite Module has a special configuration inside of it that allows certain URL's to work on osTicket. This Module is needed in order to allow osTicket to run and work properly.

In this next step I had to create the directory c:\PHP. I did that by going to file manager, clicking the "This PC" tab, then opening the Windows(c:) drive. Once i was in the c:\ drive folder i right clicked, hit the "New" tab, then hit the "Folder" tab and created the new directory for c:\PHP.

<p>
In this step I had to download and install MySQL server. After it was installed I had to set up credentials in order for me to use MySQL Server. Once I configured MySQL, it created a database for osTicket to be able to store its information on.

<p>
This is the last step before fianlly downloading and installing osTicket. I had to do some configuration in IIS as an Admin. I did that by searching for IIS and before clicking the tab, I had to right click and tap "Run as Administrator". Next i clicked on PHP Manager folder and selected "Register new PHP version". Lastly, I browsed to my PHP folder on the c: drive and selected Php-cgi.

It is important to take care of the patient, to be followed by the doctor, but it is a time of great pain and suffering. For to come to the smallest detail, no one should practice any kind of work unless he derives some benefit from it. Do not be angry with the pain in the rebuke, in the pleasure he wants to be a hair from the pain, let him run away from the pain.
